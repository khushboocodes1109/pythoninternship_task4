# Task 4 – Loops & Iterations in Python 🐍

## 📌 Internship Task Description
This task focuses on understanding **loops and iterations**, which are core concepts in Python programming.  
Loops allow us to **repeat tasks automatically**, making programs efficient, scalable, and less repetitive.

In this task, different looping techniques are implemented to simulate **real-world automation scenarios**, such as counting, decision making, and data processing.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Core Python concepts)
- VS Code (Code Editor)
- GitHub (Version Control & Submission)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By completing this task, an intern will be able to:
- Understand how loops work internally
- Decide when to use `for` or `while` loops
- Control loop execution using `break` and `continue`
- Use loops with conditions and ranges
- Apply loops to real-life programming problems

## 🧪 Concepts Implemented

### 1️⃣ For Loop
- Printed numbers from **1 to 100**
- Used to iterate over sequences like lists, strings, and ranges

### 2️⃣ While Loop
- Implemented a **countdown timer**
- Used when number of iterations is not fixed

### 3️⃣ Break & Continue
- `break` stops the loop completely
- `continue` skips the current iteration

### 4️⃣ String Iteration
- Iterated over each character in a string

### 5️⃣ Multiplication Table
- Generated table using loop logic

### 6️⃣ Range with Step Value
- Printed numbers with custom increments

### 7️⃣ Conditional Logic with Loops
- Checked even numbers
- Pass/fail evaluation based on marks

### 8️⃣ Real-World Example
- Student result evaluation using loops and conditions
